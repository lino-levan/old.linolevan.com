I've been meaning to write this for a while now but (as with many things) I have
been procrastinating.

It's finally the day of so I can't really delay much longer. Expect this post to
be windy and nonsensical, it is quite late (~23:30) as I write this.

## The past

The past year has been quite the crazy one. I graduated from high school and had
my first quarter of college. I've gone from living with my family to living
alone in a dorm room. I've gone from being a child to being an adult (legally).

Throughout all of these changes one thing I find quite constant is the
unbelievable human endurance. People, despite what you may see or think, are
able to navigate the turbulence of life quite well. Over the past year, I have
accomplished a few things other than the above that I would like to share.

### Github

I have started to lean into open source more than I have ever had in the past.
It is very easy to see the bad parts of the internet, but one thing that it has
allowed without a doubt is the sharing of information. Surprisingly, it hasn't
all been advertisements and scams. The concept of "open source" is the shining
example of this. Oxford defines it as follows:

> Denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available
> and may be redistributed and modified.

In the past, especially in the tech sector, the majority of companies were
pushing for more and larger proprietary software. It's incredible that today,
outside of a few exceptions (I'm looking at you, Nvidia and Adobe), almost every
major tech company dedicates some amount of time and money on software this is
free to use. Even Apple, a company famous for their "walled garden" approach to
ecosystem building, has started to contribute to major open source projects like
llvm.

I wanted to give a quick shoutout to these repositories by big companies. Even
if they don't need it, go give them a star:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) by Facebook
- [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) by Apple
- [Style Dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary) by Amazon
- [Chaos Money](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey) by Netflix
- [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang) by Google

Cool. I'd also like to quickly shoutout some startups that have been making the
waves in open source.

- [Deno](https://deno.land) - Objectively best javascript runtime
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) - An interesting alternative PAAS, similar to
  Firebase.
- [Nocodb](https://www.nocodb.com) - Airtable but for real databases.

In 2022, I had just under one thousand Github contributions. This can be broken
down into a few major categories. These are:

- 666 commits (spooky)
- 119 prs
- 90 issues opened

A lot of these have been my own personal projects. I'd like to give a shoutout
to:

- [CookieDB](https://github.com/cookiedb/CookieDB)
- [Afterthought](https://github.com/lino-levan/afterthought)
- [Dunosaurs](https://github.com/dunosaurs)

While I don't have any exact statistics, I've also been contributing to a lot of
open source recently. I've been mainly contributing to:

- [deno_std](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std)
- [denobyexample](https://github.com/denoland/denobyexample)
- [astro](https://github.com/withastro)

### Writing

I've also been doing a lot of writing over the past year. While I have recently
been doing it less (which is unfortunate), I am working on ~twoish short stories
and a poetry collection. I would like to share one of my masterpieces here.

```
Dryer (10/12/22)
by Lino Le Van

mmm
clothes that come out of the dryer
mmm
warm
mmm
```

I could go on and on about what I've done. I've participated in hackathons. I
made a card game. I've made a form service. But the advancement of time is
inevitable and so is this post.

## The future

The future is uncertain. This is all that can be known about it. Us silly humans
think that we are able to predict it, and I am unfortunately one of those silly
humans.

- Javascript usage will go down and Typescript will continue to be popularized
- Deno will continue to grow in adoption and become the industry standard
- Serverless will continue to grow and dominate the web development space
- NoSQL Database alternatives will continue to pop up and be popularized
- Rust will continue to gain marketshare over other low-level languages

I would also like to make some wild claims just in case any of them are true.

- A functional language will come out of nowhere and dominate the open source
  scene
- Nvidia/Adobe will start being major contributors to open source
- My blog will become an internet sensation

That's about all I have for this post. Before I go, I would like to make some
public aspirations known so I may look back on this in next year's post and
laugh. Here goes nothing:

- I would like to have 1000 Github commits (~2x my current amount)
- I would like to have 365 new poems (~10x my current amount)
- I would like to have released my card game
- I would like to have released a short story physically
- I would like to have officially joined a part of an organization I am a big
  fan of

I hope that 2023 will be exponentially better for you all than 2022 was. Have a
great year!
