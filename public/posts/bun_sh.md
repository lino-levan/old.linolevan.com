Bun.sh is a new JS runtime that has a lot of promising features.

It feels like nowadays, JS runtimes come out every couple of years. This isn't true obviously, Node came out in 2XXX. Deno came a decade later in 2XXX. Bun.sh just came out early 2XXX.

## What is Bun?
Bun is fundamentally just another JS runtime. It just so happens that its killer feature is being very fast. It is built on JavascriptCore (the same engine that Webkit uses) which is considered really fast but hard to use. It's written in XXX instead of Rust or C++ which is a bold choice given its general lack of adoption.

The cool thing about Bun is that it takes some of Deno's killer features (like first class support for TS) and mixes it with Node's incredible ecosystem.

It also has some killer features of its own. It natively transpiles JSX which is something deno can't say.
