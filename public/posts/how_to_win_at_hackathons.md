title: How to Win at Hackathons

There are three big things that both hackathon participants, regardless of their skill level, need to know to win:
1. Who is your audience?
2. What should I focus on?
3. What should my team look like?

We're going to go through each of these points 1 by 1.

but first...

## Who am I?
I'm Lino Le Van, I am soon to be leaving high school and heading off to college and I've organized ~three hackathons and participated in countless others.

In these next few headers I'm going to be bringing up anecdotes and examples that may seem strange, though I promise all of these things are something that I've experienced before.

Anyways, I'm not going to waste your time. If you really want to win, you must understand that you're not going to have fun and you're not going to feel good.

If you agree to the terms and conditions, then feel free to read the rest of this article.

## Who is your audience?
This is the number one mistake that I see hackathon participants make. I can't tell you how many times someone will make a product that appeals to their-subgroup specifically. Often times, as a student, we makes things like notetaking apps or things to make being in long lectures easier... if these things don't appeal to the judges, you're not going to win.

Let's do a quick case study. In this example there are two teams.
- One of them makes a fantastic note-taking app targeted at students.
- The other makes an app that uses machine learning to tell whether your boss is angry at you in an email or not.

If the judges are students (which is rare but does happen), the first one will most likely win.

If the judges are adults, who have been working for ten - twenty years, they are much more likely to select the second one.

The fact of the matter is that hackathon winners play the game the best, and one of the easiest ways to do that is scope out who is going to be judging your project. Most hackathons publish their judges weeks in advance, so if you want to have the best shot at winning it's worth to do a little bit of linkedin-stalking to find out who these judges are and what they stand for.

Ethically, this advice seems questionable, but I promise you the teams that don't do this don't win.

## What should I focus on?
Another question that gets brought up a lot, mostly by beginners, is "What should I focus on to win, the idea or the product?".

The answer you get from hackathon organizers varies significantly. There is one common answer which, in my opinion, is wrong.
> Focus on the idea, we're not grading you based on what prototype you are able to build in such a short time.

If you want someone to win a hackathon, this is completely the wrong advice to give. Judges, whether they be students or employees, don't care about the idea as much as how shiny your finished build looks like.

The idea doesn't have to be super in depth... it just has to look good on a screen. This will come up later in the section where I talk about what your team composition should look like, but for now hear me out.

My advice for teams that want to win through their product is as follows:
- Make a website. Apps take way too long to develop so unless you're already a professional app developer it's not worth it. It's also a lot easier to make a website look good than an app.
	- Due to the simplicity and lack of need for setup, I would recommend the tech stack of NextJS and TailwindCSS
	- DO NOT MAKE A CLI TOOL. I highly recommend avoiding Java / Python (unless you want to use it as a backend), because even if your idea is spectacular, judges will think it looks boring.
- Really make sure you NEED a database before adding one to your project. 
	- A majority of the time you don't actually need a real database, something like localStorage should be good enough for the majority of people.
	- If you really NEED a database (your demo involves more than one computer being in sync), then stick to a noSQL db like MongoDB.
- Invest some time into making the product look good. It's often worth looking at how professionals have done something similar and borrow the style (for a solid example of this, compare my [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.linolevan.com/) to [Google](https://google.com)).
- Lie. Cheat. Decieve. And don't get caught.
	- I'm not going to call out any team specifically... but when I ran [GeomHacks](https://geomhacks.com), one of the teams created a project that was particularly impressive. The basic premise was that they trained a model to take the journal of a person who may be experiencing depression and be able to tell whether or not they were """just""" depressed, or if they were feeling suicidal. I believe they were going to win second place, but then one of the teams looked at their source code and discovered it was, in reality, just randomly picking between the two. They hard-coded the specific case they were doing in the demo video. That's actually a really clever way of cheating, but next time make sure to not publish that part of the code to github ðŸ˜‰.
- Make your demo interactive to the judges if at all possible.
	- When [Oleks](https://github.com/OlexG) and I won first place at BranhamHacks, we essentially made a kahoot / gimkit clone. It was later revealed that our project wasn't originally going to get first place, it was actually supposed to score much lower. Due to our demo allowing judeges to join the game directly from their phones, it actually changed their minds on the rankings and gave us an edge over other people.

Anyways, that was a lot of advice. Let's move on to the shortest section of them all...

## What should my team look like?
![](/images/team.png)

This section is really simple and so I will keep it as short as possible. There's really only two cases.

If there is a solo prize AND you know you can build a whole project by yourself:
- Go for the solo prize. You will statistically fare a lot better this way. This is risky however because if other people are going for the prize, they are very likely to be just as if not more talented then you in building projects.

In all other cases:
- Go for the maximum team size, it's usally four.
- I recommend a team with a skillset as follows
	- A front-end person. This person will be responsible for making the website work functionally.
	- A back-end person. This person will be responsible for the backend if you weren't listening to what I was saying above about not needing a back-end.
	- An artist. This person will design the site and make some art for it. This person will be the most free to attend talks and particpate in hackathon activities.
	- The all-rounder. This person is here for three reasons:
		- If someone doesn't show up or has to leave early, this person can take over the role of the person.
		- If someone is stuck on something (weird bug in code, can't find a good design), this person can help un-stuck people.
		- This person can get everyone food/water (This is mostly a joke)

## That's it!

This is as far as my experience can take you. All that's left is for you all to take the advice I've given and go out there and practice it. 

Personally, do I recommend doing what I say here? No, not really. No one fondly remembers hackathons where they won by deception. I know you won't believe me if you've made it this far, so go out there and have fun!

If anyone wins by following this advice, send me an email. I'd love to hear what you did.
