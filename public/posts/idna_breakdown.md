I have been gone for the past few months because I have gone down the open
source contributing rabbit hole, but it has not been all fruitless.

## Background

Most of this work has been spent contributing to the
[Deno standard library](https://deno.land/std). While I'd love to talk about
every little contribution,
[one of them](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/pull/3022) stands out to me
as the most interesting. Not because it was the most technically complex (in the
end it only amounted to ~20 lines of code), but because it pushed me to learn
how to read RFC specifications.

This PR implemented node's `url.domainToASCII` and `url.domainToUnicode` into
the compatibility layer, but the journey to obtain those 20 lines of code was a
lot longer than you would imagine. My first foray into implementing these ended
pretty abruptly when I came to realize that it would requite a spec-compliant
punycode implementation. What is punycode? Good question.

## Punycode

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode):

> **Punycode** is a representation of Unicode with the
> limited [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") character subset
> used for
> Internet [hostnames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname "Hostname").

Thanks Wikipedia, that has clarified nothing at all. To translate that into
human language, punycode is a standard protocol that can be used to take any
arbitrary unicode string and convert it into valid ASCII.

For those who aren't aware, ASCII is a specification that maps the numbers 0-127
to a bunch of characters. There's so much history to talk about on that front,
but if you want a quick recap I highly recommend
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4) explained by education
Youtuber, Tom Scott.

Unicode, in comparison to ASCII's 128 characters\*, has essentially every
character that can be written on a computer. This includes things like diacritic
characters (é, ü, î, etc), non-latin characters (你好), and even emoji (😀, 🎉,
😱).

Punycode therefore defines a standard to convert from any of these characters
into standard ASCII by the following two steps:

1. Copy all ASCII characters from the input to the output
2. Encode all the non-ASCII characters with base-36 encoding and stick them onto
   the end with hyphens\*\*

While this may not sound very difficult, it's enough of the pain to not warrant
an afternoon or two of work. What I didn't realize in my first attempt at this
PR is there is already a
[punycode implementation](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/blob/main/node/punycode.ts)
in the standard library so when I discovered this, I decided to give it a second
shot.

\* Not technically 128 characters in a traditional sense. There are a
not-insignificant amount of control characters.

\*\* A lot more technically challenging than this, but this is the basic concept

## Small rant about the RFC Specification

At this point, I was dedicated to making these functions a reality. I pulled out
the [most relevant specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3490) that I
could find and started reading it. Imagine my shock going from the
[clean and complete documentation of Deno](https://deno.land/manual/introduction),
to this nightmare of a document.

RFC authors, if you are reading this, please invest in a markdown editor +
renderer (an RFC -> markdown converter is not an awful project if anyone wants
to pick that up). With a document so full of technical terms you would hope that
it was clearly annotated, but this is simply not the case and it instead forces
you into a rabbit hole of different RFCs.

If you're interested in hearing a more articulate individual explain their
gripes with old RFCs, I highly recommend
[this post](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/FtpMustDie) by the infamous `GreyCat`.

I will continue to bring up how unclear and awfully written these specifications
are as you follow me through this journey.

## The Conversion

The spec defines a set of instructions to follow for converting to and from
unicode. These steps are identical except for the usage of `ToASCII` and
`ToUnicode` which will be defined later. They are as follows:

1. Look at another RFC that leads you to another RFC for the definition of
   "stored string" vs "query string". If it is a "query string", set
   `AllowUnassigned` to true
2. Split the domain name into "labels" by the "separator". The "separator" is
   defined as three unicode symbols that all look like "."
3. Look at another RFC to see if certain bonus rules should be applied to each
   label, if so set `UseSTD3ASCIIRules` to true but only for that label
4. Apply `ToASCII` or `ToUnicode`
5. If you applied `ToASCII` make sure to join the labels by "." and not any of
   the other unicode separators

That seems... fun to write. From reading this, it sounds pretty clear to me that
we need to implement `ToASCII` and `ToUnicode` before we even get the chance to
see if this algorithm works as expected. To keep it simple, lets only look at
`ToASCII`:

1. If the input label contains anything outside of the ASCII range
   (`0000000-1111111` in binary), do step 2, otherwise skip to step 3
2. Perform the steps described by another RFC, pass the `AllowUnassigned`
   boolean from earlier. If this fails, "return an error" (?)
3. If `UseSTD3ASCIIRules` is true do the following checks. If either one fails,
   "return an error" (?)
   1. Check that there are no "non-LDH ASCII" characters in the label. I have no
      idea what a "non-LDH ASCII" character is and it does not specify
   2. Make sure there is not a hyphen "-" at the start or end of the label
4. If the input label now contains anything outside of the ASCII range, do step
   5, otherwise skip to step 8
5. Check that the string does not start with `xn--`, "return an error" (?) if
   not
6. Encode the label using punycode (which is yet another RFC)
7. Add `xn--` to the start
8. Check that the length of the string is between 1 and 63 inclusive, if not
   "return an error"

With the amount of question marks in these steps, you can probably guess how
vague the actual specification is around these things. For reference, "return an
error" in practice usually means either returning an empty string or actually
throwing an error to be caught by the application.

## End of the story

I decided to sit down and implement this for the greater good of the javascript
community. After sitting down and writing the `ToASCII` I realized that there
was another function already defined by the name of `ToASCII`. To my horror, I
discovered `idna.js` which was just Deno vendoring the quite popular
`punycode.js` library. After further investigation I realized that `ToASCII`
actually implemented the whole conversion algorithm even if it was awfully named
to clash with the specification.

My change happened to only be around twenty lines of code because it simply
called the already existing function in the source code.

## Recent news

This RFC does actually have some modern relevance. In 2017, Xudong Zheng
published [a blog post](https://www.xudongz.com/blog/2017/idn-phishing/) of a
proof-of-concept attack on https. In it, he demonstrates that you could buy the
domain `xn–-pple-43d.com` and browsers (at the time) would render it as unicode.
It just so happens that this domain name uses the Cyrillic "а" which looks
identical to the ASCII "a".

This kind of attack is only possible because of the limitations of human
communication with symbols. If you're curious on what the result of this was,
browser-makers pretty quickly patched out attacks like this by just showing the
ASCII string if the characters in the URL looked like it mixed characters from
similar character sets.

## Conclusion

I hope that you have been able to take anything from this (admittedly humorous)
journey that I went on. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to
reach out to me! I'd love to have a conversation. I'm hoping to have a "year in
review" post up by the 30th. See you then!
