After over six months of planning, [Lancerhacks](https://lancerhacks.com/)
finally happened and it went incredibly smoothly!

We did it! I will be writing at least one more post on this going over what went
right/wrong but for this one I just wanted to thank the people who made it
possible and talk a little bit more about what the actual projects looked like.

First of all, I want to thank the team that made it possible in the first place:

- Ruhi: Absolutely carried the team on basically every front. Ruhi essentially
  organized the whole event singlehandedly, with the rest of us just tagging
  along. No, but seriously, Ruhi if you're reading this you did a phenominal job
  and I'll be sure to come back next year to see how things are going.
- Everyone else: Avi, Ayush, Surya, Medha, Nina, Molly, Nitish, Pranav, Rithvik,
  Shlok, Swastik, and Angela

I also want to thank everyone who supported us:
Andy[@Gated](https://gated.com/), Sam[@Madkudu](https://madkudu.com/), Mr. Wang,
Mr. Meulman, and all of the other speakers, judges, and staff that showed up on
event day.

Lastly, I wanted to thank the participants who showed up! Thank you so much to
each and every one of you who spent an entire day doing activities and hacking.
